    I'm trying to make history but you say that we're history
    Girl i know that you're missing me
    They say that a picture's worth a thousand words
    So how come i can only think of ２ when i look at yours
    He used to be ３ yeah  used to be me
    Also  i'd get lost in those pretty brown eyes
    So look me in the face and beg me to stay
    Cause this could be the very last time
    If i'll take one more step out the door
    And if you let one more tear hit the floor
    You can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye  bye
    One last chance boy this is no joke
    You should know i'm sorry don't cut it no more
    You can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye  bye
    They say you don't know what you have till it's gone  no  no  yeah
    But i say that you knew it all along
    No matter what i get caught up in your issues
    Why do i try when i know i can't fix you
    To listen up  you really messing up boy
    Had it from a bluff i mean that when i say
    If i'll take one more step out the door
    And if you let one more tear hit the floor
    You can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye  bye
    One last chance boy this is no joke
    You should know i'm sorry don't cut it no more
    You can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye  bye
    If you want me to stay  i want you to cry  i want you to beg boy  don't ask why
    When i say jump  you say how high
    And i say don't stop till you touch the sky
    Maybe then i'll start to believe
    Everything that you say you mean
    So come and kiss me make it better baby please
    Don't make me leave  don't make me leave  no  no
    Don't make me leave  noooooo
    If i'll take one more step out the door
    And if you let one more tear hit the floor
    You can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye  bye
    One last chance boy this is no joke
    You should know i'm sorry don't cut it no more
    You can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye bye  you can kiss it bye  bye
    You can kiss it bye bye
